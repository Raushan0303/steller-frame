/* This is a binary file, so I'll just create a placeholder text explaining what it should be. 
   In a real situation, you would need to upload a noise texture image file. */

/* 
This should be a noise.png image file with a subtle noise pattern.
For a proper implementation, you would need to:
1. Generate or find a suitable noise texture (perlin noise or grain texture)
2. Save it as noise.png 
3. Place it in the public folder
4. The texture should be subtle and will be used with mix-blend-overlay at low opacity
